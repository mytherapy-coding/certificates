- **Apache Kafka**: Stream processing and real-time data integration.

## Integration Patterns

- **API-Based Integration**: Services communicate via REST or GraphQL APIs.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Systems react to events in real-time.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Moves and processes data between systems.
- **Message Queues**: Services use queues to exchange messages asynchronously (e.g., SQS, RabbitMQ).

## Example: AWS Integration with Lambda and S3

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyBucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
  
  MyLambdaFunction:
    Type: 'AWS::Lambda::Function'
    Properties:
      Handler: index.handler
      Runtime: python3.8
      Code:
        ZipFile: |
          def handler(event, context):
              print("Event received:", event)

  S3LambdaTrigger:
    Type: 'AWS::Lambda::Permission'
    Properties:
      Action: 'lambda:InvokeFunction'
      FunctionName: !Ref MyLambdaFunction
      Principal: 's3.amazonaws.com'
      SourceArn: !GetAtt MyBucket.Arn
```

# Amazon CloudWatch Metrics

## What is Amazon CloudWatch?
Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that collects and tracks metrics, logs, and events from AWS resources, applications, and services.

## What are CloudWatch Metrics?
CloudWatch **metrics** are numerical data points that represent system performance over time. Metrics help monitor **CPU utilization, memory usage, network activity, disk I/O**, and other AWS service metrics.

## Key Features of CloudWatch Metrics
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks resource performance in real-time.
- **Custom Metrics**: Allows publishing of application-specific metrics.
- **Alarms & Notifications**: Triggers alerts based on metric thresholds.
- **Dashboards**: Visual representation of key metrics.
- **Metric Retention**: Stores data for 15 months for trend analysis.

## AWS Services That Provide Metrics
- **EC2**: CPU utilization, disk read/write, network in/out.
- **RDS**: Database connections, read/write IOPS, latency.
- **S3**: Bucket size, request count, error rates.
- **Lambda**: Invocation count, duration, error rate, throttles.
- **ECS/EKS**: Container memory, CPU usage, task count.

## Viewing Metrics in CloudWatch
1. Open the **AWS Management Console**.
2. Navigate to **CloudWatch** > **Metrics**.
3. Select a namespace (e.g., AWS/EC2, AWS/Lambda).
4. Choose a metric and set up visualizations.

## Example: Fetching CloudWatch Metrics with AWS CLI
List available metrics:
```sh
aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace AWS/EC2
```

# AWS CloudTrail

## What is AWS CloudTrail?
AWS CloudTrail is a **logging service** that records **API calls** and **account activity** across AWS infrastructure. It helps with **security auditing, compliance monitoring, and troubleshooting** by tracking actions performed in AWS.

## Key Features of CloudTrail
- **Tracks API Calls**: Logs AWS API requests made via the console, SDKs, CLI, or other services.
- **Stores Event History**: Retains event logs for **90 days** (longer if stored in S3).
- **Integration with CloudWatch**: Sends logs to CloudWatch for real-time monitoring.
- **Event Categorization**:
  - **Management Events**: Logs actions like `CreateBucket`, `RunInstances`, `DeleteDBInstance`.
  - **Data Events** (Optional): Logs operations on resources (e.g., S3 object access, Lambda execution).
  - **Insight Events**: Detects unusual activity patterns.

## Viewing CloudTrail Logs
### Using AWS Console:
1. Open the **AWS CloudTrail Console**.
2. Click **Event History** to view recorded events.
3. Filter by **Time, Event Name, Resource Type, and User**.

### Using AWS CLI:
List CloudTrail events:
```sh
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --max-results 5
```
